When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository can receive contributions from another users, being a
    project more widely explored.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Some changes you may want not to publish.
