What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository, a new hidden folder is created to include the
	history of the commits. This is necessary. Without that, it's impossible to
	do commits and we have no version control of our project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is like a waiting room of a hospital. It helps to separate
	the moments to do commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	I can use the staging area version to compare with the last commit version
	before I do the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	I can use branches to make a lot of evolution types in my code, opening oportunities
	to more experimentation without losting progress on official version.

git log --graph --oneline $branch1 $branch2 ...

	This command shows the log in a graph structure to see branches and their origins.
